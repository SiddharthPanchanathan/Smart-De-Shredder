The Smart-De-Shredder tries to glue the randomly ordered shreds together in the right 
order so as to reconstruct the original image. As far as reassembling the shreds in the 
right order, note that when we “cut” the orginal image into
vertical strips, the pixels along the right edge of the “left” strip should be very 
similar to the pixels along the left edge of the “right” strip.
